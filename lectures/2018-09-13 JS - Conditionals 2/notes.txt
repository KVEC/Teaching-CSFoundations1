Agenda: cover examples below 
        Use RNG to change ball speed on bounce.  Add 2nd ball, give random colors
  	Try to get balls to react to collision
	Class challenge: Write a statement that check to see if the guess is a 3 digit number or -1:

        
Conditionals allow us to ask questions of the current program state

In Python, we write questions using IF statements
format for IF statement:
if <variable or value> <relational operator> <variable or value>:

basic relational operators:

x == y #test of equality (is x equal to y?)
x > y  #is x greater than y?
x >= y #is x greater than or equal to y?
x < y  #is x less than y?
x <= y #is x less than or equal to?
x != y #is x not equal to y?

Note, the above are all "yes / no" questions.
These are Boolean operations.
